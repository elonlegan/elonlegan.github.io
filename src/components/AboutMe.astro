			I'm a <strong>Frontend Engineer with 4+ years of experience</strong> who enjoys
			building clean, performant interfaces. I've shipped production apps with
			<strong>Angular, React/Next.js</strong> and contributed across the stack with
			<strong>Node (Express/Nest)</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			I care about <strong>UI quality, accessibility, and developer experience</strong>.
			Lately I've been deepening my <strong>UI/UX and design systems</strong> skills so I can craft
			products end‑to‑end, collaborate better with designers, and move faster.
		</p>

		<p>
			I like working on <strong>real product problems</strong>, iterating quickly, and measuring
		impact. Happy in frontend‑heavy roles while staying hands‑on on the backend when it helps
			the team. If you're hiring for frontend roles (remote or Spain), let's talk.
